/**
 * Holds the application closed until the start-up work is finished.

 * <p>Spring Boot starts the web server <em>before</em> the
 * {@code CommandLineRunner}s have run, so for the first few hundred
 * milliseconds the application answers requests with a half-built landscape —
 * a dashboard that shows two systems instead of three, and a score computed
 * over the ones that happen to exist.</p>
 *
 * <p>That window is short, but it is real: a load balancer that probes the
 * application the moment the port opens sees an empty dashboard, and
 * somebody refreshing the browser twice gets two different answers.</p>
 *
 * <p>The gate opens after every seeder has run. The runner below has the
 * highest order, so it is always the last one.</p>
